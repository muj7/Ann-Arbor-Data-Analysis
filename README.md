# Ann-Arbor-Data-Analysis
this project is for assignment in Track of Applied Data Science in Coursera. Is for Avrage and Maximum Snowfall in An Arbor, MI (1985-1990)

This assignment requires that you to find at least two datasets on the web which are related, and that you visualize these datasets to answer a question with the broad topic of weather phenomena (see below) for the region of Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States, or United States more broadly.
Here are the assignment instructions:

    State the region and the domain category that your data sets are about (e.g., Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States and weather phenomena).
    You must state a question about the domain category and region that you identified as being interesting.
    You must provide at least two links to available datasets. These could be links to files such as CSV or Excel files, or links to websites which might have data in tabular form, such as Wikipedia pages.
    You must upload an image which addresses the research question you stated. In addition to addressing the question, this visual should follow Cairo's principles of truthfulness, functionality, beauty, and insightfulness.
    You must contribute a short (1-2 paragraph) written justification of how your visualization addresses your stated research question.
